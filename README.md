### Motivation

My primary motivation for developing this project was to put all the technologies and techniques I had learned up to that moment into use. Some of them are:

- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML & CSS
- Responsive Design
- Having the front end communicate with the back end
- User Authentication

This project has a good use case of those technologies I've ventured into, and it was be an excellent platform to put them into practice.
